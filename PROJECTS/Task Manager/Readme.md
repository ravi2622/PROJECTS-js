Project Idea: Task Manager

Overview:
Create a basic task manager where users can add, view, update, and delete tasks. Each task will have a title, description, status (e.g., pending, completed), and a due date.

Requirements:

Backend with Node.js and Express.js:
Set up a Node.js project using npm.
Install Express.js to handle routing.
Create routes for handling CRUD operations on tasks (GET all tasks, GET task by ID, POST new task, PUT update task, DELETE task).
Views with EJS:
Create EJS templates for:
Viewing all tasks
Viewing a single task (for editing)
Adding a new task
Include forms in the templates for adding and editing tasks.
Frontend with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript:
Design a simple and user-friendly interface using HTML and CSS.
Use JavaScript for client-side validation (e.g., ensuring required fields are filled, valid date format).
Use fetch API or XMLHttpRequest to communicate with the backend for CRUD operations.
Implementation Steps:

Setting up the Node.js Project:
Initialize a new Node.js project (npm init).
Install Express.js (npm install express).
Create necessary folders (e.g., views for EJS templates, public for static files like CSS and client-side JavaScript).
Create Express Routes:
Define routes for CRUD operations on tasks (e.g., GET /tasks, POST /tasks, PUT /tasks/:id, DELETE /tasks/:id).
Implement controller functions to handle these routes.
Create EJS Templates:
Create EJS templates for viewing all tasks (tasks.ejs), viewing/editing a single task (task.ejs), and adding a new task (addTask.ejs).
Include necessary HTML structure and form elements in these templates.
Design Frontend UI:
Design a simple UI using HTML and CSS for displaying tasks, adding new tasks, and editing existing tasks.
Use forms with appropriate input fields (e.g., text input for title and description, date input for due date).
Add client-side validation using JavaScript to ensure data integrity.
Client-Server Communication:
Write JavaScript functions to handle form submissions and make API requests to the backend using fetch or XMLHttpRequest.
Implement logic to display task data retrieved from the server and handle user interactions (e.g., editing, deleting tasks).
Testing and Debugging:
Test the application by running the server (node app.js) and accessing it through a web browser.
Ensure all CRUD operations work as expected, and the UI is responsive and user-friendly.
Debug any issues that arise during testing.
This project should give you hands-on experience with building a basic web application using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, EJS, Node.js, and Express.js, focusing on creating a RESTful API for managing tasks.
